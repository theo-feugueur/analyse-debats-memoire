2019-11-09,Presidente,Indépendant/N/A,Italie,"Good morning. Dear colleagues, allow me to greet the Presidents of Parliament who have preceded me and who are here with us today, especially President Enrique Barόn Crespo, who was in office on the day the Berlin Wall fell.
Thirty years ago, Germany and Europe were living one of the most important and significant pages of their recent history.
After decades of suffering, the lacerating wound of the division of Germany and Europe was finding its recomposition through the fall of its most obvious and hateful symbol.
At last the Wall fell under the momentum of thousands of women and men, eager to regain their freedom and dignity after years of oppression and deprivation of their basic rights.
I want to recall that the success of that night was the result of the determination of millions of Eastern European citizens who peacefully, without any violence, but only through the strength of their own reasons, were able to free themselves from the yoke to which they had been subjected for decades.
It is also to the courage of those European citizens that I wish to pay tribute today.
Witnessing those moments was the amazement and joy of hundreds of thousands of German citizens on both sides and, alongside them, thousands of young people who had come from all over Europe to share in the overwhelming enthusiasm of those hours.
I, in those days, was among those young people, along with many perhaps of you, and I remember the irrepressible happiness, the hugs, the tears, the incredulous look on the faces of the Vopos who saw their world crumbling at the same speed as the Wall came apart under the blows of the pickaxes.
I also remember well the awareness, well rooted in all of us, that we were living through a unique and unrepeatable moment in history that finally closed a dark page of oppression, mourning, and the annihilation of freedom and personality, and opened another one full of optimism, of hope.
Today, thirty years after the fall of the Wall, we can say that that enthusiasm and that hope have not been betrayed: if the Europe in which we live today is a better place, we owe it to the European Union and the achievements it has been able to obtain.
I want to make it clear: European democracy and the values and principles on which it is based are unfortunately not irreversible. This requires the commitment and determination of all of us to defend them. This is a struggle that we must wage every day, relentlessly.
As a witness to those extraordinary days in Berlin, I cannot help but look with great concern at the return to Europe of ghosts we thought were dead, buried under the weight of history.
It is with disbelief, but also with immense anger, that we find ourselves noting how the demon of anti-Semitism is returning to our Europe today. The unfortunately numerous episodes in recent history come to mind, and I am thinking, and we are thinking, of what happened in Halle only a few weeks ago, of the desecration of the Jewish cemetery in Randers in Denmark, of the threats to which Senator Liliana Segre was subjected in Italy.
The resurgence of anti-Semitism is the fruit of the resurgence of nationalisms, xenophobia, racism, and the rejection of all that is different from us. These phenomena are also the breeding ground for terrorism that threatens Europe and the entire world with acts of violence. Just today marks the anniversary of the tragic events of the Bataclan, history that belongs to us, the history we lived through together, and our moving remembrance goes out to the 130 victims who lost their lives that night and their families.
The threat to our values also comes from outside. We are forced to confront daily with respect to interference that seeks to undermine in different forms our achievements and the security of European citizens. We must be united. Yes united, to respond to these attacks, to strengthen our union, to secure our borders.
It is against these threats that we must fight with great determination and unity if we are to fulfill the promises of that evening in Berlin when the Wall was crumbled.
I am convinced that this is a battle we can win only if we stand together. And we must do so, opposing with all our might those who mystify the facts of history, who give simple answers to complex problems, who confuse the legitimate pride each of us feels for our country, for our country and culture, with hatred and contempt for others.
It is not an easy battle. We often wonder how it is possible today for a European citizen to forget the lessons of the history of our continent and our forefathers. A history full of glorious pages, but also of suffering and horrors, such as those I was evoking just now.
The answer that I find is that of the need to insist on knowledge and remembrance, and I am referring, in particular, to the youngest who have not lived that history, but have learned it perhaps in books or on the Web or on the Internet. It is to them that I wish to address with particular affection at this time because it is in them that we place our hopes.
Today I want, we want to make our own contribution here to this challenge. We do so, in the presence of the President of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Schäuble, whom we are honored to have here today precisely to recall what happened in Berlin 30 years ago.
The floor is yours, Mr. President.
The floor to you after listening to a piece of music that will serve as an introduction to this ceremony. We will have with us a young Belgian musician, Liav Kerbel, who will play a saraband by Johan Sebastian Bach.
Entrance of the cellist.

2019-11-09,Wolfgang Schäuble,Indépendant/N/A,Allemagne," Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen! Nothing must remain as it is - on November 9, 1989, I realized what that means. The will for freedom of my compatriots in the GDR was stronger than the Berlin Wall. Throughout Central and Eastern Europe, citizens took their destiny into their own hands 30 years ago. The transformative power that this unleashed achieved what had seemed irrevocable for decades: the fall of the Berlin Wall, the tearing down of the Iron Curtain across Europe. Anyone who witnessed this moment will never forget it. And anyone who sees the pictures from back then can still feel the force of the emotions associated with it, this moment of happiness - a historical moment that stands for itself.
""We are flying into history"" - that's what the pilot of an American plane told his passengers before landing in Berlin on the evening of November 9. He could not keep the unbelievable news of the open barriers to himself, and he had an idea of their dimensions.
The Germans in the GDR, the people throughout Central and Eastern Europe were freeing themselves from communist rule, from the Soviet Union's claim to power. Nations found their way back to themselves - to actually being people's republics, because in them the citizens really did decide. Democracy and the rule of law prevailed, human and civil rights were enshrined, the market economy replaced the planned economy - and although there was no master plan for this either, the process of European unification brought 500 million people in East and West together in a peaceful development - for the better. Historically, this is unprecedented.
So let's be aware of what is possible when people stand up for something together. Especially in a parliament, which serves the necessary dispute, but which should always have the common good in mind. That is why I feel honored by your invitation - and have gladly accepted it - to speak to you about the fall of the Wall and the fortunate historical turning point for the whole of Europe - about the courage of those who demonstrated in many places in the GDR at the time, who exerted pressure on the ossified state and party leadership at great personal risk, who demanded reforms and freedom rights - or who left everything behind for their freedom and fled to the West in their thousands and, not least, managed to ensure that this revolution in Germany remained peaceful, just as it did in most other neighboring countries, whether we remember it as the Velvet Revolution or the Singing Revolution. We can only marvel at the fact that it happened this way. And it is truly a reason to celebrate!
During the Cold War, the sympathies on the western side of the Iron Curtain were with dissidents and opposition activists - Charter 77, Solidarność and the other civil rights movements in which the courageous few initially came together. Their example encouraged others until it turned into the mass protests that swept away the old regimes one by one in 1989/90. The West played an indirect role in making this possible - not least through the NATO Double-Track Decision, which forced the weakened Soviet Union to change course and enter into negotiations. The courage of the people in the East and this firm stance of the West: both contributed to the Cold War being overcome 30 years ago.
The opening of the Wall came as a surprise, but it did not come without harbingers: The election of a Pole as Pope and his powerful visit to his homeland, the powerful Polish trade union movement, the glowing candle demonstration in Bratislava, the 650-kilometre-long human chain through the Baltic states and, last but not least, the great humanitarian gesture by the Hungarians near Sopron in the summer of 1989, when they opened the border on their own authority - these and other signals pointed to change. Father Imre Kozma from the Hungarian Malteser Relief Service was looking after refugees from the GDR at the time and put into words how people's attitudes changed during these eventful months: ""Those who had learned to be afraid were suddenly no longer afraid."" Not even in the GDR.
When the government in the GDR reacted to the mass protests on November 9 by suddenly opening the border, hardly anyone was as close to the action as some Members of the European Parliament. The Committee on Legal Affairs - the body responsible for civil rights in this, your Parliament! - met from November 8 to 10, 1989 in Berlin in the Reichstag building, right next to the Wall. The parliamentarians dealt with familiar-sounding topics: the legal protection of computer programs and the use of genetically modified microorganisms. They were as unprepared as the rest of us for an event that would change the world. The parliamentary committee reacted as parliamentary committees do: It adopted an opinion. In the style of an announcement, it soberly states that it welcomes the events in Berlin.
What a contrast to the euphoria of the people! That night and in the days that followed, hundreds of thousands of people passed through the Berlin border crossings, the checkpoints between the GDR and West Germany, cheering and marveling. Strangers lay in each other's arms - 28 years after the construction of the Wall, which in reality was a death strip. At least 140 people lost their lives here. We will not forget them! And we do not forget the suffering of their relatives or the many other victims of the decades-long dictatorships in Eastern Europe.
The fact that the members of the European Parliament's committee were clearly restraining their joy was perhaps also due to the fact that nobody knew at the time whether the Wall would finally be history. The images of the violent suppression of protests in the GDR in 1953, in Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968 were still fresh in our minds. The tanks that rolled up when martial law was imposed in Poland in 1981 were still fresh in our minds, as was the violent end to the student protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in the summer of 1989. Against this backdrop, the European events shine once again in a particularly bright light.
The courage that the people had taken, their vociferous demands for reforms, a say or a change of power had shaken the communist regimes to their foundations. They were well aware of the consequences of showing weakness. Some still believed that they had to prove their strength by being particularly tough. Others were no longer in a position to do so. As different as the criticism of the ruling state party, their many-voiced demands and their expectations for political change were within and between the citizens' movements - what united them all was the goal of overcoming the lack of freedom: to shake off the permanent control, to get rid of arbitrary rule, to break down the limitations in order to leave behind the lack of prospects of the imprisoned.
Who among the young people in Europe today can even imagine that real freedom was a seemingly unattainable dream for generations? Today, as citizens of the European Union, we are free to decide how we live, where we live, study, work and trade in a large democratic area of justice. Everyone is free to express their opinion, no matter how far-fetched. Fighting for your own rights before independent courts in a free, democratic Europe - united! A dream that has become reality.
We Germans know: Without European unification, without the desire of Europeans in East and West to grow together, there would be no German unity. The one was the prerequisite for the other, both are two sides of the same coin. The four victorious powers made German unity possible by giving us what we could not claim: their trust. Just like our immediate neighbors and the members of the European Community - despite the wounds left on the continent by the Second World War unleashed by Germany. We Germans will never forget this proof of reconciliation!
Thanks to the political changes of 1989/90, the process of European unification has gathered considerable momentum over the past 30 years - from the single market and the long-planned economic and monetary union to the enlargement of the European Union to include the re-established democracies of Central and Eastern Europe.
We share the same values that we had long hoped would triumph unchallenged. This has proved to be an illusion. Instead, our democracies are exposed to global competition with authoritarian systems that advertise themselves with a high promise of efficiency and prosperity, but without granting their citizens what we in the West take for granted: freedom and social justice, progress and sustainability, democracy, the rule of law, universal human rights - everything that makes Europe worth living in and also a place of longing for many people around the world, which incidentally still makes authoritarian rulers all over the world nervous because it is obviously highly attractive.
Sometimes it seems as if we ourselves doubt it the most. Many people - especially those who once demanded freedom and participation on the streets - are not satisfied, not because they do not value freedom or democracy, but rather because the transitions from tyranny to democratic compromise are always messy, as the British historian Timothy Garton Ash once remarked. Upheavals are associated with pain.
What does the West have to offer us? The Polish poet Czesław Miłosz asked this question long before the fall of the Iron Curtain. ""Freedom from something is a lot, but it is too little, it is much less than freedom to something,"" he wrote back then. What is freedom to something? We must constantly renegotiate the answer to this question - especially as freedom as a value does not stand alone. Since the French Revolution, we have known about the triad: freedom requires equality and fraternity. This is also a European heritage!
It corresponds to the needs of the people in Europe. They do not live in a uniform space - they form a community with many different historical influences and national identities. In the West, very few people have any idea what it means to have been subjected to dictatorship and foreign rule, sometimes even twice. What do people here know about the upheavals in which people in all the states of the former Eastern Bloc had to prove themselves in the years of upheaval that followed? For most people, the freedom gained in the change of system was associated with a deep cut, also with impositions. While we talk intensively about the problems of immigration throughout Europe for good reason, people in the eastern parts of our continent are often much more concerned about the experience of emigration and its far-reaching consequences. Conversely, many people sometimes lack an understanding of how diverse even the originally old core Europe and the countries that surround it are. The West is more than just wealthy and saturated, accustomed to peace and the seemingly self-evident democracy.
The transformation towards a common Europe in East and West remains a major task for all of us, especially in view of the simultaneous rapid changes brought about by globalization and digitalization, worldwide migration and climate change, and dissolving international obligations. All of this is causing new uncertainty and fear among many people.
However, the freedom that prevails in Europe today after a century of terrible wars and the loss of humanity in dictatorships is not an imposition! At best, there are side effects; it is actually more the freedom of others that causes unease and rejection. Liberal Europe is incredibly diverse. But we still lack a common public sphere, and there is a lack of platforms for exchanging views across borders on what we have in common and what divides us. Only through exchange can we achieve a truly pan-European perspective. We can all learn from each other - especially as East Germans and Eastern Europeans have a head start on people in the West, as they have 30 years of experience with change processes. This is a valuable experience, especially since we have realized that the impositions of globalization and digitalization do not stop at anyone.
At a political level, we can only really make progress if we are more aware of and recognize each other's perspectives, not in order to adopt them uncritically, but to understand each other better - and to be able to make joint decisions.
We always tend to see our own position as the only correct one. This characterizes many conflicts in Europe. Not only, but especially between East and West, this sometimes seems to deepen rifts again. Therefore, let us not and never jeopardize the greatest achievement of the epochal change of 1989 - that is overcoming the division of our continent!
We will only play a role in this fundamentally changing world if we act together, if we fight for common positions that are shared or at least supported by the people in the Member States. We will only be able to set the tone and stand up for our values if we live up to them ourselves. And we will only be taken seriously if we substantially step up our joint efforts to effectively convey stability to the conflict-prone regions within Europe and in our immediate neighborhood.
Freedom can only be defended by those who know and live it themselves - and who do not just invoke it on public holidays. Democracy is as important for the stability of society as prosperity and prosperity. Our values tame the unbounded processes and ensure balance in global competition. But even in our 21st century, they cannot be taken for granted and are certainly not unchallenged.
Jacques Delors has left a cautionary legacy in this regard. In view of the experiences of the violent 20th century, he feared the flare-up of a new nationalism and a simultaneous increase in individualism. Both, as he saw it, threatened intra-European solidarity and social cohesion in the member states of the Union, but above all the ""open universalism"" and the capacity for tolerance that characterize our community of values - the very heritage of Europe. We should remember his, Jacques Delors', words: ""If the EU fails, this heritage is in danger of being lost."" I believe this warning is still relevant!
(Applause)
What Delors probably could not have imagined, and certainly did not want: The EU is losing one of its largest members in an agonizing process. And our continent is experiencing the return of war and violent border displacement on its eastern border. Moreover, even security partners within NATO are behaving in a way that not even critics of the alliance ever thought possible. The rules-based international order is under pressure - and this in an increasingly interconnected world in which truth no longer counts and national egoisms are lived out, but in which the most pressing issues - world food supply, migration, climate change and security - can only be answered globally.
The imperative of political common sense is therefore: more cooperation is needed. This applies to the EU's external relations, but it also applies to cooperation within Europe. Europe is only capable of acting if the member states cooperate. Cohesion is a basic prerequisite for Europe to become ""capable of global politics"", as Jean-Claude Juncker has called it. We must overcome small-mindedness, self-centeredness and fear.
The fall of the Berlin Wall and the 30 years that have passed since then show that Nothing has to stay as it is. The most massive walls can fall, change is possible if we take it into our own hands. It is up to us. Then Europe can learn from the grandiose world change of 1989/90: we are free to act courageously."
2019-11-09,Presidente. – Grazie Presidente Schäuble. Saluto la presenza in Aula di tanti visitatori,Indépendant/N/A,Italie,"Thank you President Schäuble. I welcome the presence here of so many visitors, the presence of the Finnish Presidency and also the President-designate Charles Michel. I greet the current commissioners and also President-designate Ursula von der Leyen.
We begin with the chairmen of the political groups, the floor to Mr. Manfred Weber, for the People's Party, please."
2019-11-09,Manfred Weber,PPE,Allemagne,"Mr President, I was 17 years old. A young person who was allowed to experience many new things every day. But when I saw the tears in the eyes of my parents, my acquaintances and my friends, and when I saw the pictures on TV, first of the embassy in Prague and then of the fall of the Wall, I felt, we felt: We are experiencing history here.
It was wonderful when the first compatriots arrived at my home in Lower Bavaria in the so-called Trabbis. We intuitively felt that what belonged together was coming together here. As a German, I was deeply impressed when I saw people taking to the streets in Leipzig, Dresden and East Berlin. I am deeply grateful for their courage, for their desire for unity in freedom, for their civic spirit.
They created values that still shape us today. The citizens are the heroes of unity. Their voice was heard because strong allies did not let them down. One of my first key political experiences was when Ronald Reagan stood in front of the Brandenburg Gate two years before the fall of the Iron Curtain and called on Gorbachev to tear down the Wall. The European Community, NATO, all its members were always united on one point: the division of Europe must be overcome. The support that the Americans and Europeans gave the Germans 30 years ago was a real gift.
After two destructive world wars, this leap of faith was anything but a matter of course. We should always remember this trust from our allies when we discuss the future of Europe today - even in Germany - sometimes in a fragmented and critical manner. Germany's friends did not paint failure on the wall. They saw the future, they trusted, they were true statesmen and stateswomen in many areas.
Dear Wolfgang Schäuble! The way you negotiated the German Unification Treaty was historic and - more importantly - successful. My political generation owes a great deal to you, Theo Waigel and Helmut Kohl. There were also a lot of concerns back then. I read them in the newspapers, heard them at university, in the stores, while shopping. Not everyone was enthusiastic about the developments back then either. But you didn't let it get to you, you showed leadership. Your actions and your vision were formative. Thank you for that.
We can also use this leadership today. No one doubts today that German and European unity are inseparable. Helmut Kohl was always a German patriot. But he never left anyone in any doubt: a united, democratic Europe is our common mission. He was committed to the European project in the truest sense of the word, right down to the last gear. What an ardent European, what a great statesman Helmut Kohl was, we all experienced at the end of his work when we said goodbye to him in the Strasbourg plenary chamber. The father of German unity said his farewells in the European Parliament.
Helmut Kohl knew that the fall of the Berlin Wall was not a national, singular event, nor was it a national feat. We Germans owe our unity in freedom to the courage of thousands of friends in Eastern Europe. Politicians such as Lech Wałęsa, Václav Havel and József Antall also fought not only for the freedom of their own country, but for the whole of Europe.
We should uphold the spirit of the peaceful revolution, the spirit of peaceful awakening, in our generation too. Today, a lot of small details dominate everyday politics. But today in particular, we are confronted with major challenges. We can learn from the fall of the Berlin Wall: we can only achieve something great if we stand together in Europe. Europe is the key to a better future, a future worth living, and to achieve this we need to work on European awareness today.
I love my home state of Bavaria, I like being German and I am a European at heart. We must not allow nationalists and populists to destroy this unity of identities. I like being European. Let's renew the European cohesion that we lived 30 years ago today."
2019-11-09,Iratxe García Pérez,Grupo S&D,Espagne,"Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe and the rest of humanity will never forget November 9, 1989. It was a moment of illusion, the illusion of hope. What happened that night changed the lives of the people of Europe forever; the images of the euphoric crowds on top of the wall, the queues of people and cars crossing from one side to the other were an explosion of happiness.
The bipolar world in which Europe had lived for decades, which seemed eternal and immovable, had collapsed, even then on a date of significance, because it commemorated two of the darkest episodes in our history: on the one hand, the anniversary of Kristallnacht when, on that November 9, 1938, the Nazis committed the first great massacre against the Jews; and, on the other, 1989 marked half a century since the beginning of World War II.
The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the triumph of liberal democracies in the face of the Soviet blockade, inaugurating a period of hope in which Europeans thought that nothing could stop the expansion of human rights, free elections and the rule of law. Within weeks, Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, among others, threw off their dictatorships to adopt the Western model of parliamentary democracy.
But thirty years later, new walls separate Europeans. Now these walls are ideological -between nationalists and pro-Europeans-, territorial -between the big cities and the rural world- or class -between the rich and the impoverished workers-. Although support for democracy is widespread in much of the world and, of course, in Europe, populists are gaining ground, and this obliges us to reflect deeply in order to avoid returning to dark periods in our history.
1989 was a moment of hope and victory for the West and for the values we defend. Achieving it was not easy. Our biggest mistake is to forget what it means to defend freedom.
Thirty years later, it is easy to forget that German reunification was fraught with uncertainties and misgivings. Some thought it would put such an immense economic and social strain on Germany that it would put an end to the European locomotive and, as a consequence, to the European Community. Others warned of the danger of resurrecting an old enemy buried since World War II.
No one knew better than Helmut Kohl how to capture the feelings of the European partners. In his memoirs, he recalled the lack of support and confessed the following: ""Among our European allies, there was only one who supported us resolutely from the very first moment: the Spanish President, Felipe González, who did not hesitate for a moment about the position he should take.
If it was possible in 1989, we must now also be able to respond to the uncertainties that threaten our model of coexistence. The European Union is above all peace, freedom and progress. Let us walk with these values and let us make our Union the most advanced model of integration and social justice, and let this anniversary serve to restore hope.
In 1989 I was also a young woman, somewhat older than Mr. Weber. I was just fifteen years old - almost as young as my country's democracy - but I was already beginning to build my political awareness and was aware that this was an important day in the history of Europe. But I could never have imagined that today I would have the honor and pride of representing the social democratic family in this European Parliament. For me it is a source of pride, but above all a great responsibility, to take the baton from the men and women who built such an important moment for our political project and for guaranteeing peace, freedom and justice."
2019-11-09,Dacian Cioloş,Renewing romania's european project,Roumanie,"Mr President, in November 1989 I was 20 years old. I was in my first year of university and we were living through one of the harshest communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe - that of Ceausescu. We heard about the fall of the Berlin Wall only a few days after it happened on Radio Free Europe, the radio that allowed us to connect illegally to the rest of the world at that time.
On November 9, 1989, a wall dividing Europe in two was destroyed, and with it began, at least in Europe, the end of a regime that survived only by the state limiting the freedoms and rights of citizens.
The fall of the Berlin Wall had a domino effect. Only a month and a half later, Ceaușescu's national communist regime also came to an end. Like other young people of my age, like other Romanians, like other Central Europeans, I was thirsty for freedom, democracy and Europe, because on the streets of Timișoara, where the movements started in Romania, or in Bucharest, the demonstrators were already calling for Europe. The aim of the vast majority of those who were in the streets was a return to the values of democracy and European civilization, as the Timișoara Proclamation states.
Thirty years ago, a wave of democratization was being felt in Europe and in other parts of the world, but for more than ten years, freedom and democracy have been losing ground worldwide. More than half of the world's citizens live under political regimes lacking or partly lacking fundamental freedoms, and in Europe the temptation to build walls again continues to threaten us. And those of my generation who have lived with and without walls. We cannot fail to see this similarity.
Brexit, for example, means new barriers to trade and freedom of movement. I hope that British citizens who have always fought for a free Europe will think twice before building new borders. The reaction of some when it comes to Europe's migration challenges is to call for new walls. Walls have no place on this continent, we don't want to build a fortress Europe. Rather we need to build bridges and close partnerships with Europe's neighbors.
Dear colleagues, the walls are not just physical, they are also fear-imposed barriers to political freedom and prosperity. Political parties and leaders with authoritarian tendencies in Europe, who want their country or Europe to flirt again with the dictatorship of the past, must be stopped. Democracy and European freedom must be defended from those who have no hesitation today in reaping the benefits of membership of the European Union, but who reject its values. Thirty years after the fall of Berlin, we have a responsibility to defend the ideals and values in the name of which that wall was destroyed: freedom, democracy, prosperity and the European Union.
In the coming months, we will have to launch a Europe-wide conference on our common future, involving all the citizens of the European Union, in order to lay the foundations for a new European project which will inspire confidence for the years to come, because I, as a Romanian, cannot imagine being Romanian without being European in the same sense, and I am convinced that we all, regardless of our ideologies, feel this way. So why not express these things naturally and convey this feeling, the European project that we support?"
2019-11-09,Ska Keller,Verts/ALE Group,Allemagne,"Mr President, thirty years ago, the Wall did not just fall, it was brought down by very courageous people, people who took a very high and very concrete personal risk. They fought for fair and free elections, for the freedom of expression, for an end to being caged-in and under constant observation – all those things that we take for granted right now. But back then, those demands could get you into prison, they could get you tortured, lose your job and lose your social connections. But despite all of those risks, people took to the streets, organised already long before 1989, and never gave up. It is this courage that changed the world and it is this courage that’s still changing the world today.
Also today, we need to be vigilant, not to forget the lessons from 1989. Democracy needs to be gained every day again and again, in every action that we do here in this House but also everywhere in Europe. Unfortunately, there are governments right now who are trying to dismantle democracy, bit by bit. This is a disgrace, especially given the sacrifices that the citizens in countries like Hungary made to free their country. Those who shut down universities, those who arrest civil society and build walls against refugees, they are betraying the demonstrators from 1989.
(Applause)
Freedom is something that needs to be expanded every day as well and too many people are still not free in this world, not free for who they are, whom they love or where they’re from. We are all citizens of this world, born free and born equal. Discrimination and hatred should not prevail.
Freedom of expression is also being curbed when hatred and threats are being issued and used against people active in politics, active in their communities. When people there are faced with threats on an everyday level, then this is a problem for freedom of expression, as well as democracy. Constant observation is also becoming a trend again, but we should never forget what history teaches us – surveillance, a control state, does not lead to freedom or security. It ends both. We don’t know what the future will bring, and any law we do here always needs to work also when governments don’t mean well.
Things have changed a lot over the past years, over the past 30 years especially. If you look at the border zone now that once divided Germany, where hundreds of people lost their lives trying to cross looking for freedom, often also being assisted by other people who helped them, this area is now a major production area, safeguarding climate and biodiversity for the future generations and becoming a symbol of hope. The borders that divided Europe have now become places where people meet, get to know each other. But let’s not forget, there are many walls still up today that need to be torn down. There are many people today, as back then, who are looking for freedom. Let us not turn our back on them. Let us not forget what it means to look for freedom, to not have it and then to gain it.
Without the courageous people thirty years ago, I wouldn’t be here and many colleagues would not be either. Europe as we know it, only exists because the wall that divided us all finally was torn down. But 9 November 1989 is not a date where we should hold commemoratory speeches and just congratulate each other on how well it all worked back then. I believe it is an anniversary to remind us to be courageous, to tear down the walls that divide us and to be the change that we want to see in the world."
2019-11-09,Jörg Meuthen,ID,Allemagne,"Dear Mr. President, Dr. Schäuble, President of the Bundestag, ladies and gentlemen! Thirty years ago, in one of the happiest moments in German history, the Wall came down.
Our compatriots in the former GDR took to the streets in a totalitarian and brutal system. They demonstrated, they risked their health, even their lives. This heroic and consistently peaceful effort ultimately brought down the Wall and caused a socialist regime of injustice to implode.
So far, so gratifying, so right, so wonderful! But what was supposedly swept away with the peaceful revolution is back again today. Socialism and communism were not - as hoped - finally defeated back then. It is alive, it is rising again before our very eyes. Today, even the successors to the SED are celebrating German unity with deep hypocrisy, as are the socialist Greens and the Social Democrats. Back then, they all wanted to prevent German reunification at all costs!
Today, Berlin itself is governed by a deeply red Senate that is seeking expropriations and destroying the price mechanism in order to prepare for exactly that. The socialists and communists sit in the German Bundestag, and they grin at you openly here in the plenary of the European Parliament, where they implement their freedom-destroying agenda day after day: Planned economy instead of market economy, dictates of correctness instead of true freedom of expression. Has the lesson of history still not been learned? Every type of socialism always and without exception brings poverty, impoverishment, terrible injustice and violence. Unfortunately, all of this remains undefeated.
One last thing: if you look at the festivities these days, you might think that people are celebrating the European Union today and not the achievement of German unity. However, the peaceful revolutionaries of 1989 did not chant ""EU, united fatherland"", they shouted ""Germany, united fatherland"". They were fighting for freedom, for identity, for democracy and - yes - for Germany's national sovereignty. They did not fight for socialism through the back door, nor did they fight for the European Union. Meanwhile, here you are working on overcoming the nation states in favor of an identity-less nothing called the United States of Europe.
Sooner or later you will see: The freedom-loving citizens of Europe will also bring down this absurd Tower of Babel, because that is not what people took to the streets in 1989, risking their lives and their necks.
If we do not return to a Europe of sovereign fatherlands, in which nations coexist peacefully and cooperate meaningfully with each other, the EU as a whole will one day implode and Brexit will only be the beginning of this implosion. Do not underestimate the will to freedom! It is utterly European. Those who sin against it will have no lasting success."
2019-11-09,Ryszard Antoni Legutko,ECR Group,Pologne,"Mr President, communism was the most murderous system in the history of mankind. More murderous, perhaps, than German national socialism. As somebody who, for many years, lived in a communist country, I feel it is my duty to repeat this truth over and over again. I’m afraid that what I’m going to say will be rather bitter and out of tune with what has been said before.
The division between those who supported communism and those that opposed it, at that time, was far from clear. Let me remind you that in the 1970s and 1990s, the Soviet Union became a vital part of the international order. It was accepted as such. The West European governments conducted realpolitik towards the Soviet regime and accommodated its aspirations. For the same reason, those governments looked at the anti-communist movements within the Soviet bloc with suspicion, treating them as trouble- makers, courageous, politically naive yet jeopardising the international order. These movements disturbed the détente, they disturbed the Ost politik. They stood in the way of the policy of the majority of West European governments which were, or had been for a long time, openly pro-Soviet.
The involvement of the Western elites in the legitimisation of communism had serious consequences. The communists continued their careers afterwards, after the system fell, and some of them joined the European Parliament, joined the European institutions, some are still here. They rebranded themselves as Social Democrats, jumped from the bandwagon called the Soviet system to another bandwagon, which is called the European Union and they were greeted heartily. Overnight, the apparatchiks, the Partiegenossen became enthusiastically European. Super-duper European.
The communist system should have discredited the political Left in Europe. Unfortunately, it didn’t. In fact, the Left acquired a dominant position in Europe after the demise of the Soviet Union. The Christian Democratic, Conservative, Republican parties have capitulated to the Left agenda, which I find rather pathetic, and as a result, the spirit of communism lives on in Europe. It has been recycled, it has been garnished, has been updated, has been slightly civilised, remodelled, but it is there alright.
The Left always had totalitarian temptations and no wonder they continue the policies which I remember very well from my young days living in a communist society.
Today we are more and more in the grip of one correct ideology, with political correctness running wild. We had a sample of it here, right here at this session. We tend to create a new form of de facto one party system which is called political mainstream. Again, we had a sample of it this afternoon. We have militant, aggressive, secularist and barbaric social engineering. Again, these were the trademarks of the communist system. We have a neo-Marxists very much alive and kicking today.
So all this considered, ladies and gentlemen, the anniversary is fine. We all remember those great days, but it is not the time for sentimental ruminations and it is not time for political self righteousness. it is time for a revision, and I mean it."
2019-11-09,Martin Schirdewan,GUE/NGL,Allemagne,"Mr President, at this stage of the debate, I am sorry to say that not all speakers have done justice to the great task at hand. But I would like to thank those who have made differentiated statements.
""It's as if someone has thrown open the windows. After all these years of stagnation. The intellectual, economic, political."" Stefan Heym said this at the big demonstration on Berlin's Alexanderplatz on November 4, 1989. With the Wall, which fell five days later, the Iron Curtain that separated Eastern and Western Europe economically, militarily and not least ideologically also came down piece by piece.
It is largely thanks to the East Germans who spent months demonstrating for democracy and civil liberties that we are able to hold this debate here in the European Parliament today - 30 years later. Thank you for that too.
Mr President, I myself was born in East Berlin and experienced the Wall as a child. This also gives me the opportunity to tell a more nuanced story than the two previous speakers. According to the German government's latest report on the state of German unity, the vast majority of East Germans are dissatisfied with the way German unity and the post-reunification period have gone - Mr Schäuble, you referred to this. And why? I would like to give you an example, ladies and gentlemen. Today, East Germans still have to work more hours per week and at the same time earn less than their West German colleagues. In terms of national figures, of course, East Germany has the largest low-wage sector in the entire European Union. This means that 30 years after the political turnaround, we need a social turnaround, not just for Germany, but for the entire European Union.
But it is not only social and economic developments that are still drawing boundaries that should have disappeared long ago. It is also the mistakes that have been made in recent years in dealings between East and West - by which I mean not only East Germany and West Germany, but also between Eastern and Western Europe.
Let me give you another example, that of the writer Stefan Heym, whom I quoted at the beginning. He comes from a Jewish-German family. As an anti-fascist, he fled from the Nazis to the United States and returned to Germany as a soldier in the US army to liberate Germany from National Socialism. In 1952 - he is a US citizen - he decides - and he is already an internationally recognized writer - to settle in the GDR.
In 1994 - a few years later, after the fall of the Berlin Wall - he was elected to the Bundestag as a non-party member on my party's list and became the senior president, and unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, the conservative parliamentary group left the chamber as a whole when he was elected. Mr. Schäuble, you will remember that. I think that was a major historical mistake. I believe it was a cultural break.
These are the stories of victories and defeats. These are life stories that need to be told and heard today, also in order to stop the attempts of the extreme right to appropriate the history of German unity, the history of the fall of the Wall, the history of European unification, as we have unfortunately had to experience again today.
The people in Hungary, in Poland, in Czechoslovakia and not least in the GDR wanted a future in an open, peaceful and liberal Europe. They, on the other hand, stand for a Europe of the past, of nationalism and new walls. Anyone who wants to erect walls at the external borders of the European Union again today, anyone who pursues a policy that leads to people dying while fleeing instead of finding help, has understood nothing, absolutely nothing, about the fall of the Berlin Wall and European unification."
2019-11-09,Mislav Kolakušić,European Alliance for Freedom and Democracy,Croatie,"Dear predsjedavajci, the destruction of the Berlin Wall is one of the greatest events in the modern history of Europe. The brave citizens of East Germany, under a regime that was extremely repressive, were not afraid to take to the streets and to tear down the Berlin Wall in a unified manner.
The destruction of the Berlin Wall made it possible to create a new, modern Europe. It made it possible for many other countries and peoples to become free and independent in their own countries. The independence of the Republic of Croatia is, unfortunately, paid for by more than 20 000 murdered citizens. However, there is a great opportunity to create a modern Europe in which we can all live with dignity. The European Union is a vehicle for creating a modern democratic Europe. However, we must be aware that, even thirty years after the Berlin Wall came down, some new walls stand between Member States.
A barbed wire has been erected on the borders of Croatia from the other two Member States of the European Union, Slovenia and Hungary. This is not something that is for the best. We must respect the borders together. Apart from this barbed wire, we have another wall, and that is the Schengen wall. All Member States must be part of the Schengen area. Otherwise, we cannot consider ourselves to be equal and equal members of the European Union.
I would therefore urge you to defend the entry of all countries into the European Union area and to become one in this respect."
2019-11-09,Frans Timmermans,Indépendant/N/A,Pays Bas,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. When I was born, it would have been a bold dream that we would one day decide on our common future in a European Parliament with Members from East and West. The Wall was built in the year I was born, and for me, as for many Europeans, it is closely linked to my personal history. When I was a young soldier, the Cold War was so icy that I was trained to fight against those with whom I am united in a union today. The year the Wall came down, our son Mark was born, and when Europe finally became one again with the eastward enlargement in 2004, our son Max was born.
Our children, like a whole generation of young people, have the privilege of knowing Europe exclusively as a continent of peace, freedom and unity, and we also owe this to the peaceful revolution of 1989. For me and all those who were lucky enough to experience it, it is the most formative political event of our lives. It is also the victory of European values, because people's longing for freedom was greater than their fear, their desire for democracy stronger than ideology and their cohesion more powerful than the regimes in East Germany, Central and Eastern Europe. It was the civil courage of these people that rewrote the history of our continent, and their civil courage was truly European.
The spark of freedom was also ignited in our neighbors at that time: in Polish Solidarność as well as in the Pan-European Picnic on the Hungarian-Austrian border and the Baltic Way. What belongs together is growing together, as Willy Brandt said, and he meant not just Germany, but Europe as a whole.
We also owe this united Europe to the courageous actions of neighbors and partners who opened up to a reunited Germany at the heart of the continent. That was not a matter of course at the time. It was not only a courageous step for US President George Bush and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, but was also particularly important for France and Great Britain. It meant embedding Germany in Europe and daring to create a whole new dimension of Europe: a Europe that reunites its two halves, that unites Western, Central and Eastern Europe into a single continent. This is exactly what we have experienced over the past 30 years.
I still remember well that before the fall of the Wall I could almost feel and see whether I was in the West or the East, and it wasn't just because of the special smell of Trabbis and GDR cigarettes. In contrast, when I travel with my children in Eastern or Western Europe today, there are still cultural differences, because diversity is Europe's wealth, but you can't tell where people come from. They are interested in the same topics and have the same worries, hopes and dreams. There is no longer an old and a new Europe in the traditional sense. Nor is it the case that the East has joined the West. No, we have grown together to form our Europe!
One of the greatest successes after the fall of the Iron Curtain was, as Václav Havel aptly described it, that East and West are no longer moral designations, but have become purely geographical designations. The foundations of our Europe are democracy, freedom and human rights. The rule of law must reign in Europe. This was, is and remains the main mission of the peaceful revolution in 1989. Freedom and equal rights for all - unity and justice and freedom, I would say. It is the responsibility of us all to respect and defend these values. They are the true achievement of Europe. Only in this way could Europe, united in solidarity, become a continental success. Our successful single market creates jobs, guarantees access to education and health insurance and creates opportunities for every individual. We must therefore resolutely oppose all those who, in the so-called national interest, conjure up Ostalgie or Westalgie or other unprecedented pasts in order to play East and West off against each other in Germany and in Europe.
There are still challenges in growing together. We are all aware of this. But that does not change the fact that the EU is the best thing that could have happened to East and West. It must be clear to us: Anyone who gambles with Europe is gambling away the future. And anyone who really wants to act in the interests of their country will rely on Europe. Only together can we play our part on the world stage and help shape the rules of the game. If we want to continue the mission of the people of 1989 today, then we must also show European courage, and that also means courage for Europe. Because we can only master the challenges of the future - from climate change to the digital revolution - by joining forces.
When Willy Brandt was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1971, he said that peace was not a primal state, but rather had to be achieved by people again and again; above all, social justice was crucial for lasting peace. Because - according to Brandt - material need is concrete lack of freedom. It remains our common European task to overcome this. It is Europe's destiny to work on this.
Dear Wolfgang Schäuble, thank you for showing us what we are fighting for. And Mr. Meuthen, thank you for showing us what we are fighting against."
2019-11-09,Tytti Tuppurainen,Indépendant/N/A,Finlande,"Mr President, it is a great honor to address this Chamber on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
I do this not only in the capacity of the Minister holding the rotating Presidency of the Council, but above all, I do it as a European citizen.
This task makes me very humble because, although I was very young, I very well remember the difficult times when Europe was divided. In the middle of Europe, Germany was split in two and the great city of Berlin was divided by the wall. The wall which, for decades, separated family members from one another. The wall which meant the final stop for fundamental rights and freedoms. The wall which ruthlessly ended the lives of many of those trying to get to the other side.
All of this happened in the heart of Europe.
For younger generations, this may now seem somewhat unreal and even very distant, but you do not have to look at European maps further back than the 1980s to understand that it was not so long ago when Europe looked very different to how it looks today. However, over time, the will of the people seeking freedom, seeking human rights and seeking prosperity, prevailed.
It all became real in Berlin. It literally tore down the wall. This was the wind of change that swept across Europe and resulted in the collapse of the Iron Curtain. In Europe this paved the way for the deepening of European integration and similarly it paved the way for the enlargement of the European Union, of our precious Union.
Ladies and gentlemen! Despite this great change, which was achieved 30 years ago through the courageous and determined action of the peoples on the former eastern side of the Iron Curtain, we still face challenges in Europe.
Some of the achievements of the European Union are perhaps taken too much for granted. Worldwide, we are seeing tendencies to build new walls instead of tearing them down.
We are seeing signs that proper international cooperation is being called into question. In such a turbulent and unpredictable period, it is good to get back to basics and remember the fundamental values that also led to a major change 30 years ago.
That is why I am proud to say here in the European Parliament that democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights must always be defended because they are the cornerstones of the European Union.
I would like to state very clearly that authoritarianism, totalitarianism or nationalism must never be our answer. Our choice should always be freedom. Our choice should always be democracy, and our choice should always be human rights.
Mr. Schäuble, you said that we share the same values. That is true. But it's not just us, it's the whole world. These values are the values of the whole world, recognized by the United Nations.
Ladies and gentlemen, ""Now what belongs together is growing together."" When the Berlin Wall came down, these were the wise words of the former Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Willy Brandt, who was also the former Mayor of West Berlin and had seen the European divide in a very concrete way.
I firmly believe that the message of unity is also the key to the success of the European Union. We can only be strong together and we need a Europe that unites, not a Europe that divides.
The fall of the Berlin Wall holds the promise of a united Europe."
